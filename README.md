# Bomber Man game
The final project of the "Advanced Programming" course \
In this project, I have developed the famous Bomber Man game using Swing and Socket Programming. This game could be played in both Single and Multi player mode. In single-player mode, you are a character constantly trying to get away from the ghosts and use bombs to attack them. In multi-player mode up to 4 players can join a room and try to attack each other. after a certain amount of kills, the highest-ranked player is announced as the winner!
